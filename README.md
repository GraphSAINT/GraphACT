**NOTE**

* The GCN training algorithm, together with the implementation is based on the paper ``Accurate, Efficient and Scalable Graph Embedding'' in IEEE/IPDPS '19.
  * Or, you can refer to our more recent [ICLR '20 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04931) (and its [implementation](https://github.com/GraphSAINT/GraphSAINT)) for a better graph sampling based minibatch training algorithm. 
* The implementation for redundancy reduction algorithm, FPGA architecture and the performance model will be uploaded soon.
